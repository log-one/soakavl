            Along it's journey to the French Broad river, stormwater can pick up
            animal waste, trash and debris, sediment, oils and chemicals, etc.
            and severely decrease the water quality of the French Broad and the
            streams that precede it.

            The French Broad Riverkeeper has also found high levels of e-coli in
            Town Branch, and the section of the French Broad River that all
            three streams flow into has E-coli levels that frequently exceed the
            EPAâ€™s recommended limit for safe swimming.

            When it rains, a stormwater system of inlets, storm drains, pipes,
            and ditches carries runoff to local water bodies. Stormwater is not
            carried to a wastewater treatment plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a lack of pervious surfaces to help slow down the flow of
            stormwater, heavy rains can often overwhelm a city's stormwater
            drain system and lead to flooding.
